Difference Engine
January 17, 2017

The provided files comprise a program to simulate Babbage's difference engine. On a Unix machine,
simply execute "make" to compile the program into "diffeng" in the current directory.

The program is run with no arguments, and it will prompt for, first, the first row of values that
would be computed using the method of differences; enter these numbers each on their own line,
and when done entering values, enter an empty line. The program will then ask for the number of
rows to be calculated, inclusive of the one just entered.

After receiving the input, the program will calculate and output the requested number of 'x' and
'y' values for the given row of the method of differences table.

Also, note that test output files can automatically be generated by executing the commands
"make output/[file]" where [file] is any of the test files in the input/ directory. Each output
file will contain 30 rows based on the given input file's first row, as described by the name. For
example, input/xsquared.txt creates an output file with the values for y = x^2 from 0 to 29.
